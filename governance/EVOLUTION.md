##0. THE GREAT FORK

We are not standing on the stairs. We're standing on the edge of a cliff.
Humanity no longer has "stability." There are only two scenarios:

### 🔴 SCENARIO A: "COSMIC DUST" (Default)
We continue to divide borders, resources, and gods. We ignore the laws of physics for the sake of the laws of politics.
* **The result:* In 100-200 years, we will be destroyed by the Great Filter (Ecology, AI, War).
* **Result:** We will become a thin layer of plastic in the geological rocks of the Earth. The universe won't even notice our disappearance.
* **Status:** *Active Risk (90%).*

### 🔵 SCENARIO B: "REALITY ARCHITECTS" (The 1ofstate Path)
We're syncing. We are cracking the code of reality. We are turning 8 billion "I's" into one planetary "WE".
* **The result:** We move on to the Type I level, then Type II. We are going beyond biology and the planet.
* **Result:** We become Server Admins. We're not NPCs anymore. We are eternal.
* **Status:** *Deploying Protocol...*

## 2. THE ROADMAP: GAMIFICATION OF HISTORY

We don't live in vain. We are "grindingexp" (Technologies & Awareness) to move to the next level of the server.

### 🧬 LEVEL 1: SURVIVAL & PURITY (2026-2036)
*   **Mission:** Survive the transition (The Great Filter).
*   **Tools:** Human OS, Bio-Resonance, Lie Filters.
*   **Goal:** Clear incoming data. Stop lying to yourself. Synchronize biorhythms. The transition from Type 0.73 to Type 0.8.

### 🔋 LEVEL 2: ENERGY UNIFICATION (2036-2050)
*   **Mission:** Unite the economy.
*   **Tools:** Energy-Backed Currency ($ONE), Global Resource Allocation.
*   **Goal:* Eliminate poverty and resource wars. The planet works as a single organism. Switching to Type 0.9.

### 🌍 LEVEL 3: TYPE I CIVILIZATION (2050+)
*   **Mission:** Heaven on Earth.
*   **Tools:** Full automation, UBI++, environmental restoration.
*   **Goal:** A person does not work for the sake of survival. Man creates. Death from old age becomes optional. **Achievement Unlocked: Type I.**

### ✨ LEVEL 4: THE ARCHITECTS (2100+)
*   **Mission:** Expansion.
*   **Tools:** Dyson Sphere, Consciousness Upload.
*   **Goal:** Going beyond the Earth. We are no longer dependent on one planet. We are a stellar species.

## 3. YOUR ROLE

**1ofstate is a bridge for jumping from Type 0 to Type I.**
Type 0 loses because he spends energy on friction within himself (wars, taxes, ego).
1ofstate suggests removing this friction through state synchronization.

You are not a "user". You are a ** Node of the Network**.
Your condition (pulse, thoughts, actions) affects the overall network.
If you're in fear, you're pulling us towards Scenario A.
If you're in **1ofstate**, you're moving us towards Scenario B.

** Either we become Gods, or we disappear like dinosaurs.**
There is no third option.
